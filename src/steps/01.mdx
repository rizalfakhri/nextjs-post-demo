To start, in an empty folder, create a `package.json` file and then add the following dependencies: `react`, `react-dom`, `next`, `node-fetch` and a few more we'll need later.

Also, add the scripts section.

> Throughout this post, I will assume that you have some experience with React. I will also introduce the features that we are using from Next.js one by one, but ideally, you should already be familiar with the framework's core concepts.
