Let's do something more interesting and draw part of the data from the JSON file.

Extract the last stats from each country, and pass it to the `HomePage` component as the `rows` prop.

`rows` should look like the following:

```json
[
  { "country": "Albania", "deaths": 20 },
  { "country": "Algeria", "deaths": 96 },
  ...
]
```
