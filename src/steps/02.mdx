### Pages

Next.js projects need a `pages/` folder. There you put JavaScript files that Next.js will turn into pages for your site. You only need to choose a filename and export a React component. The filename becomes the route to that page.

To try this, create a `pages/index.js` file. In that file, export a React component. For now something that renders `<h1>Hello</h1>` will be enough.

Next.js will pre-render `pages/index.js` into `index.html`.
