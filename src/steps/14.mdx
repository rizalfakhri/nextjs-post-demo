Before creating the country page, there's another Next.js API you need to be aware of: the [`Link` component](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-reference/next/link).

Without using `Link`, the browser will download everything from scratch every time the user navigates to another page.

Using `Link`, the transition between pages is handled by Next.js, which downloads only the code and data needed to display the next page.

Even better, Next.js starts downloading the resources for the next page when the user hovers over a `Link`.
