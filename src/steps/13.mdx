### Links

It would be nice to be able to click on different countries to go to a page with more details.

For now, wrap each country rectangle inside a link to a country page. A click on Italy will go to `/country/Italy`, a click on Spain to `/country/Spain`, and so on.

You don't need to write a page for each country manually. Next.js has a feature called [dynamic routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/routing/dynamic-routes) that solves this for you.
