If you use `getStaticPaths` for a page you also need to use `getStaticProps`.

Inside `getStaticProps` you can access the page `params` using the `context` parameter. And then use the `params` to send some props to the page component.

For now, just pass the country `name` as a prop to the `Country` component.
